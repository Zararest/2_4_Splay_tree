# Searhc tree

## Implementation 
This repository implements a Splay tree and tests for it. This search data structure stores keys of an arbitrary type. Possible tree queries:

```cpp
void add_new_elem(T_key new_elem);         //adding an element
bool find_elem(T_key elem);                //checking for the presence of an element
int number_of_elems(T_key from, T_key to); //number of elements between given keys
```

To print the tree, use the function `void dump_graphviz(const char* out_name)`.

The number of elements search function uses an improved algorithm based on additional information in the nodes of the tree.

## Tests
Implemented tests to check the correct operation of the tree and compare the speed of work with `std::set`.

Comparison the results of performance tests of Splay and [AVL](https://github.com/Zararest/2_2_Search_tree) trees are given in the file `./bin/results`. Measurements were carried out on queries generated by the Gaussian distribution with the parameters specified in the file.

## Build
Before building the program:

```Bash
mkdir build 
cd ./build
cmake .
```

There are three build targets in the project:

```Bash
make Splay_tree
make Splay_tree_test
make Splay_tree_perf
```

1. `Spay_tree` - build a program to work with input data.
2. `Splay_tree_test` - build a program for testing Spaly tree.
3. `Splay_tree_test` - build a program for performance tests.
